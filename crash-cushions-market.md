<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crash Cushions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-redirective Crash Cushions</li><li>Redirective Crash Cushions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crash cushions are safety devices designed to absorb impact and reduce injuries in vehicle collisions. The market is primarily divided into two types: non-redirective and redirective crash cushions. Non-redirective crash cushions absorb energy upon impact but do not redirect the vehicle, making them suitable for areas where space is limited. Redirective crash cushions, on the other hand, manage impacts by guiding the errant vehicle away from hazards, enhancing safety in high-speed environments and crowded roadside situations.</p></p>
