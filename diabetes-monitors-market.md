<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diabetes Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Point Sample Test Based Glucose Monitors</li><li>CGM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diabetes monitors can be divided into two main types: Point Sample Test Based Glucose Monitors and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems. Point Sample Test Based monitors require the user to manually prick their finger to obtain a blood sample for testing, providing a snapshot of glucose levels at a specific point in time. On the other hand, CGM systems continuously monitor glucose levels throughout the day, providing real-time data on trends and fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Both types of monitors are important tools in managing diabetes effectively.</p></p>
