<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroendovascular Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare Metal Coil</li><li>Hydrogel Coated Coils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuroendovascular coil market is primarily divided into two types: bare metal coils and hydrogel-coated coils. Bare metal coils are traditional devices made of biocompatible materials, used to occlude aneurysms by promoting thrombus formation. In contrast, hydrogel-coated coils feature a polymer layer that expands upon contact with blood, enhancing resistance to embolic flow and improving stability. Both types are crucial in treating intracranial aneurysms, with each offering distinct advantages in terms of performance and patient outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Neuroendovascular Coil Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aneurysm-Embolization</li><li>Malformation-Embolization</li><li>Ischemic Stroke-Revascularization</li><li>Stenosis-Revascularization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuroendovascular coil market focuses on minimally invasive treatments for cerebral vascular conditions. In aneurysm embolization, coils are used to occlude aneurysms and prevent rupture. For malformation embolization, coils assist in treating vascular malformations like arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In ischemic stroke, coils facilitate revascularization by restoring blood flow to affected areas. Additionally, coils address stenosis by dilating narrowed blood vessels, improving cerebral circulation. This market is driven by technological advancements and increasing prevalence of neurological disorders.</p></p>
