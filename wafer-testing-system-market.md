<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Testing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-layer System Structure</li><li>Multi-layer System Structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A single-layer wafer testing system structure involves a simpler design with testing performed on one layer of the wafer at a time. This type is typically used for simpler testing processes or for smaller production scales. On the other hand, a multi-layer system structure involves a more complex design where testing is carried out on multiple layers of the wafer simultaneously. This type is often utilized for more advanced and high-volume production purposes. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and functionality of semiconductor wafers.</p></p>
