<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Energy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Flash</li><li>Double Flash</li><li>Triple Flash</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal energy market can be categorized into single flash, double flash, and triple flash systems based on how steam is extracted from geothermal reservoirs. </p><p>In a single flash system, high-pressure steam is released from the geothermal fluid, producing electricity directly. The double flash system extracts steam twice, enhancing efficiency by utilizing the remaining fluid. A triple flash system further maximizes energy extraction by performing an additional flash, allowing for even more steam recovery. Each type increases efficiency and power output, catering to varying resource characteristics.</p></p>
