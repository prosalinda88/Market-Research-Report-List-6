<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Co-oximetry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission Type</li><li>Reflectance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Co-oximetry is a method used to measure the concentration of different hemoglobin derivatives in blood. There are two main types of co-oximetry devices on the market: transmission type and reflectance type. Transmission type devices use a light source and detector on opposite sides of a blood sample to measure the absorption of light. Reflectance type devices use a single light source and detector on the same side of the sample to measure the reflection of light. Both types are valuable tools in monitoring patients' oxygen levels.</p></p>
